# DLR-UQ

This code framework can be used to reproduce all numerical results of the paper "Dynamical low-rank approximation for Burgers' equation with uncertainty". The code is written in the programming language Julia (Version 1.6.0).

To run the code, go into the Julia environment and type include("main.jl"). This section will generate all plots except for the rank study in Figure 6. This plot can be generated by typing include("driver.jl"). To run the code, the following Julia packages must be installed: PyPlot, NPZ, ProgressMeter, LinearAlgebra, GSL, FastTransforms, FastGaussQuadrature. This can be done via the Julia package manager (https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/Pkg/).
